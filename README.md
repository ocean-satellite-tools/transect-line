This creates a series of equally spaced points between two points and then creates an image of the change in the remote-sensing variable over a period of years.

The example of a colorbar against time. This is chlorophyl on a transect away from Kochi. y-axis is kilometers from the coast. It is not very interesting since there are so many missing values.
